# 3.2 Existing Business Process
The current system for managing applications is entirely manual, leading to inefficiencies and limited productivity. Applicants are required to fill out and submit their applications via paper forms, and staff must manually verify information and check eligibility criteria. The review process is also conducted manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The sample of paper forms are listed below:

### 3.2.1 Member Registration Form
In order to become a member of KADA, applicants are required to fill out the member registration form with their personal details. The form will be received by KADA and the application will be evaluated in a board meeting later.

### 3.2.2 Member Financing Application Form
When a member of KADA desires to request a loan, they need to submit their application via the member financing application form. The application form will record the details of members that want to make a request for loan and then be reviewed by the employer for approval. The office records the application date and the existing loan amount contributed by the applicant.

### 3.2.3 Financial Statement Verification
The financial statement of KADA summarises the member's share information and loan information, allowing members to clearly view their current financial statements. At the bottom of this form, members need to verify the accuracy of their financial status and sign to confirm that the financial statement is accurate.
