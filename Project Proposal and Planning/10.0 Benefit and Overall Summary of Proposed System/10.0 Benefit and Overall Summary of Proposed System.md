# 10.0 Benefit and Overall Summary of Proposed System
Our proposed system addresses the efficient systems to manage their operations and interactions by providing specific features for new users, members, board directors and administrators. This system streamlines processes, improves communication, ensures accurate data management and makes operations more efficient. 

First of all, this system simplifies and automates a variety of tasks for all user groups. For instance, it can shorten the time required for new users to become active members by enabling them to immediately register via an online system. In addition, members may simply manage their financial activities, such as purchasing shares and applying for loans, through a user-friendly interface. After this, board directors can systematically evaluate and approve applications using a dedicated dashboard, which speeds up the decision-making process. Administrators can easily update application and member data in the meantime, ensuring that records are always correct and up to date. Due to this automation, workflows are sped up and less manual work  is required, increasing system efficiency.

In addition, the system improves communication by providing users automated updates and notifications. Upon account approval, new users receive confirmation emails that update them on their registration status. Members receive notifications about their financial transactions, such as share purchases and loan approvals, so they are always in touch with their account activities. Administrators and board directors have the ability to leave comments and notes on applications, which are directly shared with the relevant users. This minimises misconceptions and delays by ensuring that everyone is informed in real-time.

Furthermore, this system can ensure accurate data management by allowing administrators access to and control over member profiles, application data, and loan information. As a result, all data is verified and always be current and accurate. This accuracy is crucial for making informed decisions and maintaining trust in the system. Furthermore, frequent updates and organised data storage help to avoid errors and discrepancies, ensuring that all users have access to accurate information. 

Overall, our proposed system will transform KADA's manual procedures into a productive and user-friendly digital system. Online loan applications and membership registration will boost operational speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Besides, members will benefit from a simple application procedure that includes real-time updates. A centralised database will save money by eliminating the need for paper forms and human labour and enhancing data management and security. Meanwhile, detailed reporting and analytics will help make more informed decisions. In conclusion, this system helps KADA achieve its goals for success in the future while addressing current challenges.
