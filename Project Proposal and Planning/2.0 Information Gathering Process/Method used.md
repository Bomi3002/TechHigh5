# 2.1 Method used
In this project, we have chosen to employ an interactive method, specifically interviews, for gathering information. Interviews offer us the opportunity to directly engage with the users and stakeholders, facilitating a deeper understanding of their needs and requirements.

During the online meeting session with Koperasi Kakitangan Daerah Kelantan Berhad (KADA) via Webex on 14 May 2024, their representative, Encik Ahmad shared insights into their existing system, which is the entirely manual process. After the sharing, our class prepared various questions to learn more about their operations. Encik Ahmad kindly participated in the Q&A interview session, giving us valuable insights into KADA's requirements and system needs.

After the online meeting, we created a WhatsApp group. This group includes our lecturers, representatives from each team and important personnel from KADA. It serves as a platform for quick clarification on any unclear points, ensuring efficient problem-solving and contributing to a system design that meets KADA's requirements. By actively engaging with stakeholders through interviews, we ensured that our proposed system aligns closely with KADA's objectives and enhances operational efficiency.

In addition to interviews and group discussions, our methodology also encompassed an unobtrusive approach through observation. We closely observed systems similar to KADA's, comparing their processes to those currently employed by KADA. This comparative analysis allowed us to understand the unique characteristics and advantages of each approach. Furthermore, we directly observed KADA's existing systems, contemplating how manual processes could be seamlessly integrated into a unified system to better serve their organisation. This observational component proved invaluable in our effort to comprehensively understand KADA's operational landscape and identify opportunities for system enhancement.

The systems that we observed include:
