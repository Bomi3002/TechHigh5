# 2.2 Summary from method used

The online sessions and group discussions served as invaluable platforms for gathering information about KADA's operations. These gathering methods allowed us to identify the shortcomings of the existing system and collectively agree on the potential for designing a system to address these challenges. Through direct engagement with KADA representatives and collaborative discussions within our team, we gained a comprehensive understanding of key processes such as member registration and member financing application (loan). Furthermore, these interactions allowed us to delve into crucial cooperative terminology like "Modal Syer" and "Modal Yuran," providing us with the necessary foundation for planning and designing the system. Observations also helped us understand the practical application and user interactions with the current system, highlighting areas for improvement. Overall, the insights gleaned from these sessions have been instrumental in shaping our approach and ensuring alignment with KADA's specific needs and objectives.
