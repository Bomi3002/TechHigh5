# 7.0 Scope of the Project
This system is a web-based system and accessible via popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge on desktop and laptop computers. Besides, it also allows smartphone and tablet  users to access it with a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. There will be four different user groups in our system: administrators, board directors, members, and new users. Each of them can execute certain tasks within the system, with limitations defining what can and cannot be done. These restrictions define the scope and boundaries of the system, as well as its functionalities and exclusions. 

First, from the view of new users, they are allowed to create an account, which is necessary to access this system. New users will fill out a registration form with personal information, including their name, email address, phone number and password. After the account is approved by the board directors, they will receive an email or a message and the system will create an account for the user, enabling them to log in and use the system. These features are designed to make the onboarding process smooth and user friendly, ensuring that new users can quickly become part of the system and utilise its full range of features.

From the viewpoint of members, they can make payments for their shares directly through the system. Upon successful payment, members receive a confirmation and the details of their shareholding are updated in their profile. Then, they can track dividends earned from their shares, including payment dates and amounts. Beside that, members can also apply for a loan by filling out the online loan application form within the system. The required information may include types of loan, loan amount, income details, and employment information. Hence, members can upload necessary documents directly through the system. This may include proof of income, identification documents, and any other required paperwork. If the loan is approved, members receive an approval notification through the email, including the terms and conditions of the loan.

From the board directors, they have the authority to approve or reject the applications submitted by members. This system provides board directors with a dashboard where they can review pending applications and use it during the meeting session. The decision will be recorded in this system and  will notify the applicant for the outcome. Approved applications proceed to the next step, while rejected applications may be sent back with feedback or reasons for rejection. Moreover, board directors can access financial reports where they can access the statements, including balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. 

Last but not least, administrators have access to this system to modify member, member application, and loan application data. For example, administrators have access to comprehensive profiles of all members. This includes personal data, membership status, and history records. Administrators can use this to update the information that members can request to be changed for a variety of reasons, like changing their name or address. 

To sum up, this system allows the following four user groups: administrators, board directors, members, and new users. New users can create accounts and have access to the system once approved. By supplying the required data and supporting documentation, members can apply for loans, manage their shares, and keep track of dividends. Board directors have access to financial records and evaluate, approve, or reject member applications. Administrators can update and modify loan information, application data, and member data to make sure correct and current records. This structured approach ensures smooth onboarding, efficient application processing, and comprehensive data management.
