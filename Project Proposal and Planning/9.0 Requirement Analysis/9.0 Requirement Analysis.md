# 9.0 Requirement Analysis
### 9.1 Current Business Process 
One day, a potential member went to KADA to register himself as a member of KADA. He fills in the member registration form with his personal information such as name, identification card number, address, monthly salary, and position. After submitting the member registration form, the approval of becoming a member will be discussed at a board meeting by the board directors. After the discussion ends, the applicant will receive a call informing whether his applicant is being approved. If the applicant is approved to become a member of KADA, the member’s information will be stored in the database. 

After becoming a member of KADA, RM55 will be deducted monthly automatically from the salary of the member and saved into the member’s savings (Simpanan Tetap) and the welfare savings (Tabung Anggota). 

If the member wants to apply for a loan, he needs to fill in the member financing application form, find two guarantors, and get the endorsement of his company. Then, the application will be discussed at the board meeting and he will be informed the status of the application through a phone call. After the loan is being approved, the member’s salary will be deducted monthly to repay the loan according to the loan repayment table.
