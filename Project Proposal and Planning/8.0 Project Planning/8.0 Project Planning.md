# 8.0 Project Planning

### 8.1 Human Resource
This project would require various skill sets such as system analysis, project planning, project management, system designing, system development, system testing and maintenance. Our team comprises 5 members and along the journey, we would be learning and honing these skills. 

Since all the members have different skill levels, there would be continuous learning and skill development among team members to enhance capabilities and adapt to evolving project requirements. Besides, flexibility in roles and responsibilities would be maintained to allow for dynamic task assignments based on project needs and individual strengths.

Even though the team is small, communication is paramount to facilitate collaboration and information sharing among team members. The team would have a WhatsApp group for general communication and a GitHub repository (TechHigh5) for the team progress. Besides, regular meetings would be held for updates and to ensure each member has the same direction.
